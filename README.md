# What Ive learned
Working on this Pygame project has honed my Python programming skills by allowing me to apply concepts such as object-oriented programming, randomization, and color manipulation in a practical context.


Through implementing features like star movement and color variation, I've gained a deeper understanding of Python syntax, data structures, and algorithmic thinking, which has contributed to my proficiency as a Python developer.


The iterative process of debugging, optimizing, and iterating on the codebase has not only improved my problem-solving abilities but also instilled in me a sense of resilience and determination essential for success in Python programming and beyond.

## Description

This project simulates a starfield using Pygame. Stars move towards the viewer, creating a 3D effect.

## Installation

To play the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


2. Install Python and Pygame if you haven't already. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/) and install Pygame using pip:


3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

4. Run the main.py file:
